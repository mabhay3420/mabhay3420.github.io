"The Prophet", A collection of poems written by Khalil Gibran.


The Prophet is a person who lived in the city
for 7 years waiting for A ship to come which will take
him to his Home ( A metaphor ). Finally Ship has arrived
And while Prophet Plans for departure, People of city gather
to meet him for the last time.

Every Poem Starts with people asking about topics such as "love", "work",
"pain" , "home", "Children" etc. The prophet shares his wisdom with them.
The conversation is presented in the form of poems.

Below are my favourite quotes from the book.


1 End of Struggle

I will Update the list as i read more. All images were 
made using Adobe spark and i plan to use the same in future. 
None of the images are copied from internet because 
there is no point in doing so.
