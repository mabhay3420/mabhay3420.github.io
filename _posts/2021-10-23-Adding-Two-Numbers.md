Abstractions are everywhere and that's because they are very useful. They hide the
complexity and allow us to focus on important aspects of problem/situation. Object oriented programming,
Operating Systems and multiple branches of Mathematics essentially use powerful
abstractions. In order to reason about them, we use the properties that has been
proved for them in advance.

However, using abstraction without understanding the internals is something we do
each day. Some of them are taught to us and some we constructed in our mind as we 
contineued to learn more and more.  These are the things that become obvious over 
time that we don't even think about why they are true in the first place.
