While spending his days in Robben Isand Prison,
Nelson Mandela used to recite a poem by the 18th century English poet, William Ernest Henley.
This poem inspired him and other prison mates to stay put and keep going through the hard times.


>   Out of the night that covers me  
    Black as the pit from pole to pole,  
    I thank whatever gods may be  
    For my unconquerable soul.
> 
>   In the fell clutch of circumstance,  
    I have not winced nor cried aloud.  
    Under the bludgeonings of chance  
    My head is bloody, but unbowed.  
>    
>   Beyond this place of wrath and tears  
    Looms but the Horror of the shade,  
    And yet the menace of the years  
    Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.  
>    
>    It matters not how strait the gate,  
    How charged with punishments the scroll,  
    I am the master of my fate:  
    I am the captain of my soul.
