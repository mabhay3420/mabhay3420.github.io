I have been doing many random things for the past two years.
Lately I started to organise them into github repos. Skipping the
random things, below i list the ones i have organised properly:

1. Implementation of [HPSSA
Construction Algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3078659.3078660) in
the LLVM Compiler
Framework : <a href="../FILES/HPSSA_REPORT.pdf" target="_blank">Report</a> | <a href="../FILES/HPSSA_PPT.pdf" target="_blank"> Presentation </a> | Presented in [LLVM-CGO Performance Workshop April 2022](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2022-04-03/#hot-path) : <a href="../FILES/HPSSA_LLVM_CGO.pdf" target="_blank">Presentation</a>

2. Implementation of [Ball Larus Path Profiler](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/243846.243857) in LLVM Compiler Framework : <a href="" target="_blank">Presentation</a>
