I have been doing many random things for the past two years.
Lately I started to organise them into github repos. Skipping the
random things, below i list the ones i have organised properly:

1. [Artificial Neural Networks](https://github.com/mabhay3420/Deep-learning-Projects/tree/master/Introduction_2_ANN) : Summer project Completed under Programming Club, IIT Kanpur
2. [Mathematics Of Deep Learning](https://github.com/mabhay3420/Deep-learning-Projects/tree/master/Mathematics_of_dl) : Implement and Visualize Algorithms from scratch; Ideas Discussed in [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
3. [Basic Coding](https://github.com/mabhay3420/coding-basics) : Implementation of basic data structures and algorithms.
4. [IITK-COIN](https://github.com/mabhay3420/iitk-coin) : Backend of A pseudo coin system written in go
